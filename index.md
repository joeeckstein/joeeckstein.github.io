<img src="/assets/img/tait_hq.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="border-radius: 10%;"> I currently am Control Engineer at [TAIT](https://www.taittowers.com/) based out of the Global Headquarters in Lititz, Pennsylvania building world class automation systems for the entertainment industry on a variety of technologies including TAIT's Navigator Automation Platform, Siemens Simatic S7, and Beckhoff TwinSAFE. I look after the control systems for our projects with a focus on Functional Safety. I contributed to projects such as [Wynn Las Vegas's Awakening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0W4jLxHij0), [Celine Dion's Courage World Tour](https://www.jeckstei.com/projects/#celine-dion---courage-world-tour), and the [Celebrity Apex Oculus Theater LED Wall](https://www.jeckstei.com/projects/#celebrity-cruises---apex---oculus-theater-led-wall).

I graduated from [California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in December of 2018 with a 3.22 Major GPA. I have a passion for automation and entertainment technology, and have worked for various groups operating and maintaining audio visual equipment for events such as club meetings, presentations, and concerts throughout my education. As part of my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, I took courses in microcontrollers, optical and wireless communication systems, remote sensing, and control systems.

During my undergraduate career at Cal Poly, I was an Audio Visual Technician II for [Associated Students, Inc.](https://www.asi.calpoly.edu/) specializing in project management, equipment maintenance, sound reinforcement, projection, and lighting for production events. Additionally, I was an Instructional Student Assistant for CPE 133 (Introduction to Digital Design) assisting students with designs in VHDL using the Vivado Design Suite for the Digilent Basys3 Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board.

<div class="content">
    <p>The Control Engineer is responsible for developing and engineering controls solutions for projects, ensuring that TAIT's solutions are engineered to the highest levels of quality and safety. The Control Engineering team focuses on upfront technical due diligence in earlier phases of the Project Process, identifying challenges early to limit discovery in later project phases, resulting in less re-work and improved Performance to Estimate (PTE) and On-Time Completion (OTC).</p>
    
    <p>Control Engineering involvement in a project will continue past the design & engineering phase when a project involves particularly complex or custom controls solutions, or if the nature of the project requires a high level of engineering rigor.</p>
    
    <p>TAIT is the World Market Leader in designing, constructing and delivering the finest live event equipment in the world. Whether it’s creating awe-inspiring spectaculars, complex touring stages, theatre engineering solutions, brand activations or cruise ship installations, TAIT pledges to deliver world-class solutions for live experiences. With its proprietary entertainment automation platform, custom-made products, and creative engineering, TAIT’s cutting-edge offerings continue to advance industry standards and exceed client expectations. As a global network of over 600 employees in 12 office locations, TAIT has worked on projects on all 7 continents and even outer space. TAIT’s diverse group of clients include Taylor Swift, Cirque Du Soleil, The Metropolitan Opera House, NASA, National Geographic, Beyoncé, and The Olympics.</p>
    
    <h3> Responsibilities </h3>
    
        <p>- Understanding of entire automated systems, and how the various disciplines (mechanical, controls, artistic, etc) interact.<br>
         
        - Focus on functional safety.<br>
        
        - Work closely with both mechanical and electrical design teams to ensure that systems are designed to meet safety requirements, and function according to best automation practices. Be a productive contributor to design reviews.<br>
        
        - Develop and document theory of operation for systems, capturing key design factors and assumptions.<br>
         
        - Performing safety analysis to satisfy both internal TAIT standards and external client requirements.<br>
         
        - Identifies architecture and key controls technologies to meet project needs.<br>
         
        - Developing custom PLC projects and software configurations when required for projects.<br>
         
        - Researching new products and solutions, and when necessary building and testing prototypes.<br>
         
        - Provide smooth handover to controls integration team during shop and/or site commissioning phases.<br>
         
        - Generate technical content for project documentation.</p>
