# StrengthsQuest™

Cal Poly has every incoming student take the Gallup StrengthsQuest assessment.&nbsp;By discovering, developing, and applying one's strengths, one can achieve academic, personal, and career success. The five signature themes below are mine.

The following excerpts are taken from the Gallup® CliftonStrengths® Quick Reference Card.

## Learner
People especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.

## Deliberative
People especially talented in the Deliberative theme are best described by the serious care they take in making decisions or choices. They anticipate the obstacles.

## Harmony
People especially talented in the Harmony theme look for consensus. They don’t enjoy conflict; rather, they seek areas of agreement.

## Intellection
People especially talented in the Intellection theme are characterized by their intellectual activity. They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions.

## Relator
People especially talented in the Relator theme enjoy close relationships with others. They find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.
